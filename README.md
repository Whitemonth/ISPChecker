ISP check v1.0

This application gets your external IP address with redundancy from two sources:
1) http://myexternalip.com/
2) https://api.ipify.org/

Data from http://myexternalip.com/ gets twice, in RAW and in JSON type.

Then data compares with each other and displays the actual data in a basic user interface.
